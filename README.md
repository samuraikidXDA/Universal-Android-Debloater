UPDATED SCRIPT ON GITLAB 2021

https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater

# Universal Android Debloater

**DISCLAIMER**: Use this script at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything that could happen to your phone. 

## Summary
I try to provide and maintain a universal tool which remove bloatwares on any (unrooted) Android phones. 

The main goal is to improve battery performance and privacy by limiting the tracking from preinstalled apps. The script has a menu that lets you choose what debloat list you want to use. I strongly encourage you to take a look at the lists because some apps are commented out by default. All packages are as well documented as possible in order to provide a better understanding of what you can delete or not.

This script *should* be safe with the default selection. The worse thing which could happen is preventing an essential system process to be loaded during boot causing then an unfortunate bootloop. After about 5 failed system boots, the phone will automatically reboot in recovery mode and you'll have to perform a FACTORY RESET. 

In any case, you can NOT brick your device with this script ! That's the main thing, right ? :smiley:

## Features 
* [X] Quick search among all the packages of your phone
* [X] Uninstallation of system/user packages (manually or with the debloat lists)
* [X] Reinstallation of system packages (manually or with the debloat lists)
* [X] ADB backup (not really reliable, see the FAQ)
* [X] Device brand detection and auto-selection of the appropriate manufacturer debloat list
* [X] Logs in `debloated_packages.txt` and `remaining_packages.txt`.
* [ ] Installation of alternative open-source apps replacing stock apps (list in the WIKI section) (WIP)

NB : It is NOT a real uninstallation for system apps (see the [FAQ](https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater/-/wikis/FAQ))
